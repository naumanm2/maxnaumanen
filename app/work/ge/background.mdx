**Process**

Ge Healthcare approached with a need for a light rework on Clinical View based on user data. After our careful analyzing of the same user data, a larger redesign was seen appropriate. Clinical View is a portal that serves healthcare professionals with latest research and other professional medical content. A goal for the site was to generate returning users through engaging content. A particular aspect recognized was also the usability of [Clinical View](clinicalview.gehealthcare.com), which is why a larger redesign was seen appropriate and needed from all stakeholders after first presentation of user research findings.

**Design** 

A complete overhaul was not seen as just, but a significant revision of current elements visuality was due. New components included all needed interactivity states that make the new user interface more user friendly.
