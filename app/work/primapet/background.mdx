**Overview**

Hau-Hau Champion, Finland’s dog food brand leader, wanted to allow dogs to try out food before their humans buy it. Our interactive dog house is connected to a digital poster; outdoors, and inside malls across Helsinki. A canine face recognition system, powered by AI, scans the dog’s head.

The algorithm recognizes the dog’s size and selects the right and the healthiest kind of kibbles according to each pet. Then, a sample of the selected food is served in the bowl for the dog to try. By syncing their smartphones with the machine, owners can buy their best friend’s favorite with just one touch.

**Development**

My responsibility in team included full ownership of development. With python and object recognition, backend could send query to frontend to simultaneously as it sent a task to Arduino. This is how display could communicate to users what had been going on while dispensing food to dogs.
