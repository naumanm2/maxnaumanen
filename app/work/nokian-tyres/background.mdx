**Process**

Nokian Tyres needed a refresh on their online presence. Old website environment was deemed repetitive and boring, and it was out of line with Nokian Tyres brand.

Project started with careful evaluation of all available user studies by third parties. In addition, we had to form deep understanding of current information architecture

After evaluation, a proposal where company information would be separated into its own website environment was formed. Thus, company site, [company.nokiantyres.com](https://company.nokiantyres.com/) was separated from other content. 

Target users for new website environment were formed through analyzing user data. These findings were validated through various workshops with different stakeholders. Deliverables were user persona cards, journeys and information architecture maps.
